    <img src="cake.webp" alt="This is an image of a vegan cake" />
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Easy cake that does not take a lot of time to make! It's vegan too!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>150g dairy-free spread, plus extra for the tins</li>
      <li>300ml dairy-free milk, we used oat milk</li>
      <li>1 tbsp cider vinegar</li>
      <li>1 vanilla pod, seeds scraped</li>
      <li>300g self-raising flour</li>
      <li>200g golden caster sugar</li>
      <li>1 tsp bicarbonate of soda</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the filling</p>
    <ul>
      <li>100g dairy-free spread</li>
      <li>200g icing sugar, plus extra for dusting</li>
      <li>4 tbsp jam, we used strawberry</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <p>
        <li>
          Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line the bases of 2 x 20cm
          sandwich tins with baking parchment and grease with a little of the
          dairy-free spread.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Put the dairy-free milk into a jug and add the vinegar, leave for a
          few minutes until it looks a little lumpy. Put half of the vanilla
          seeds and all the other cake ingredients into a large bowl, then pour
          over the milk mixture. Using electric beaters or a wooden spoon, beat
          everything together until smooth.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Divide the mix between your two tins, then bake in the centre of the
          oven for 30-35 mins or until a skewer inserted into the middle of the
          cakes comes out clean. Leave them in their tins until cool enough to
          handle, then carefully turn out onto wire racks to cool completely.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          While the cakes are cooling, make the filling. To make the vegan
          buttercream, whisk or beat together the dairy-free spread, icing sugar
          and remaining vanilla seeds until pale and fluffy. Dairy-free spreads
          do vary, so if the spread you are using is quite soft, try to avoid
          using electric beaters. Stir the ingredients together instead to avoid
          overworking it. However, if the mixture is too firm, use electric
          beaters to help lighten it and add 1-2 tbsp dairy-free milk when
          whisking.
        </li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>
          Spread the jam onto one of the cooled sponges, top with the
          buttercream, then place the other sponge on top. Dust the assembled
          cake with a little icing sugar or caster sugar before slicing.
        </li>
